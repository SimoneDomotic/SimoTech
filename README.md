Once the liters have been set, select the selector on AUTOMATIC (2) and press Start (3), the relay will turn on and in doing so the valve will pass the water.
Once the setpoint is reached the relay will switch off and the current count will return to 0.
Using the selector in MANUAL (2) it will be possible to manually control the relay (4) or reset the Current count (5).
